I am a last year M.Sc. student in Biomedical Engineering at Universidad de los Andes advised by [Pablo Arbelaez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k0nZO90AAAAJ&hl=en). As part of the Biomedical Computer Vision ([BCV](https://biomedicalcomputervision.uniandes.edu.co/)) group, I lead the transcriptomics line of research, developing deep learning and computer vision techniques to diagnose disease and predict gene expression from histology images. My research is funded by a Google DeepMind scholarship. [[CV](uploads/resume.pdf)]
